# x64-Assembly-SDL
This repository is me logging my attempts to learn x86-64 Assembly and Graphics programming by coding up some SDL2 demos

I'm trying to learn assembly for when I make compilers for my Problem-Oriented-Languages. I'm using SDL to interface with X (without messing with Xlib/XCB) I would also like to target Linux KMS directly down the line.

My eventual goal is to make a web browser from scratch using little to no libraries.
